# Congratulations!

You have just learned the **basics of EU DCC** and created and verified a **Certrificate**.

EU-DCC has **much more to offer**!

Have **5 more minutes**? Take a look at **[versioning](../tutorial-extras/manage-docs-versions.md)** and **[i18n](../tutorial-extras/translate-your-site.md)**.

Anything **unclear** or **buggy** in this tutorial? [Please report it!](https://github.com/ehn-dcc-development/eu-dcc-business-rules/discussions)

## What's next?

- Read the [official webpage](https://ec.europa.eu/health/ehealth/covid-19_en).
- Study the [EU-DCC specification](https://github.com/ehn-dcc-development/eu-dcc-overview) 
- Discover the Open Source [Reverence Implementations](https://github.com/eu-digital-green-certificates/dgc-overview)
